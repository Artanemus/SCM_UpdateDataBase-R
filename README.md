### USING SCM_UpdateDataBase

After install, (by default) an icon isn't placed on the desktop. This is a service application and has no excuse to clutter up your desktop. Type **updateD** in the windows search bar to discover it. Else navigate to the **Artanemus** folder on the start bar. (All SCM applications and utilities are located in this folder.)

### ON START-UP

>**ALWAYS** make a backup of your database before running this utility!

The `Update DataBase` button will not be visible until a connection to the database server has been established. UPDB requires the SQL command utility, sqlcmd.exe. If you are using this application to update the database on a remote database server, then sqlcmd.exe must be correctly pathed.

After clicking the UpdateDataBase button you are prompted to confirm. Press `Yes`.

### ERRORS?

The application's memo-pad displays progress and any errors. Additionally, check the log file for MS SQLEXPRESS errors. This can be found at `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\SCM_UpdateDataBase.log`.
